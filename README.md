## Design Concerns

Designing custom form controls in a rubust and user-friendly way is a daunting task with many pitfalls.

Some of the boxes we need to check:
* Has an obvious focus style that makes it stand out from the other controls when in use.
* Can be controlled by keyboard alone without the aid of a mouse.
* Is accessible to screen readers.
* Stores data in a serializable way to be submitted upon form submit.
* Respects the tab order of the page and can be focused in this way.
* Works reliably across all devices and on mobile.
